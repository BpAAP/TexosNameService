# Frontend redirection page

This folder contains example files for a page which shows a loading screen and redirects the user to the latest version of a site.

For this IPFS example, it resolves the CID of the site from a smartcontract on the Tezos Testnet blockchain. Then redirects the user to view this file using the cloudflare IPFS gateway.


## Packages used:
