# TezosNameService

This repo includes an example Tezos smart contract for a name service for use with decentralised websites/applications, along with instructions for deploying the contract and interacting with it. These and further details can be found in `/Backend`.

An example loading page that shows how to demonstration can be found in `\Frontend`, along with further instructions.

This project is oriented with IPFS in mind, but is easily adaptable to whatever else.
